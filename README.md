## 💫 About Me
Results-driven Full Stack Developer with deep expertise in designing, developing, and deploying scalable, high-performance web applications.

⚙️ **Backend Specialization:** I specialize in the Java ecosystem, creating robust and resilient back-end services using Spring Boot, Hibernate/JPA, and architecting complex systems with Microservices Architecture and RESTful/Reactive APIs.

🌐 **Frontend Delivery:** I deliver comprehensive end-to-end solutions by utilizing modern front-end frameworks like Next.js and React with TypeScript to build responsive, optimized, and user-centric interfaces. I leverage utility-first CSS frameworks, including Tailwind CSS, alongside traditional styling methods for rapid UI development.

🚀 **Impact & Leadership:** My focus is always on tangible impact: I have achieved significant improvements in application performance through load time optimization, code splitting, and advanced caching strategies. Highly experienced in leading development teams, mentoring junior colleagues, and optimizing code (e.g., 40% code duplication reduction) to achieve high reliability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).

🤝 **Practices:** Highly experienced in Agile (Scrum) environments. Committed to Clean Code principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and applying technical expertise across the entire stack, from system design to production deployment.
